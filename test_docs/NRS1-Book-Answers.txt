=== Chapter 1 - Introduction To Networking

1. B. ARPANET
NSFNET was the follow-on network, DARPA is an organization, and DoDnet
does not exist.

2. D. The U.S. Department of Defense
All of the other answers are incorrect.

3. B. Bandwidth
The network needed to support diverse systems in a reliable manner over diverse
media. There was not a great need for large amounts of bandwidth.

4. C. Support for applications such as email
NCP provided support for applications like email; it did not provide any of the
features in the other answers.

5. B. Layer 3-TCP
TCP is a Layer 4 protocol. The other answers are incorrect.

6. C. Requests For Comments
The other answers are incorrect.

7. B. IXPs
The other answers don’t address the question.

8. D. A single provider could offer SLAs to each location.
A single provider can offer SLAs because the traffic would be contained entirely
within its own network; other providers can provide the services in the other
answers.

9. B. Live video streaming from sports events
Live streaming video for sports events would clearly fall into the content scope of
services. The other services are all commonly offered by all service providers.

10. C. Connection-oriented with guarantee of delivery
“Connection-oriented with guarantee of delivery” describes the basic functions of
using TCP. The other answers are incorrect.

11. B. TCP
Originally the functions of both TCP and IP were in a single TCP protocol.

12. B. HTTP, TCP, IP, Ethernet
The headers are placed in front of each other in order of the protocol stack from
the highest layer down, so the order would be application, Layer 4 (TCP), Layer 3
(IP), and then Layer 2 (Ethernet).

13. D. IP and Ethernet only
A router would remove the Ethernet (Layer 2) header, examine the IP (Layer 3)
address to determine how to forward the packet, and then replace the Layer 2
header for the appropriate next-hop interface.

14. C. Remove the entire Layer 2 header and create a new one based on the next-hop
interface.
Answer B is incorrect because the next-hop interface might be a different layer
technology so the router cannot simply replace addresses; it must create a new
Layer 2 header. The other answers don’t describe the forwarding process correctly.

15. D. IS-IS
IS-IS is a routing protocol developed by the ISO that is still in use in many provider
networks. The other answers are either not ISO protocols or are no longer in use.

=== Chapter 2

1. C. SR-6
This is not a product in the SR line; the SR line contains SR-12, SR-7, and SR-1.

2. B. It supports OSPF, IS-IS, RIP, and BGP.
The Alcatel-Lucent 7450 ESS is designed primarily as an Ethernet aggregation
point and so it does not support provider protocols like BGP.

3. D. boot.ldr—Bootstrap image file
This is the only correct pairing.

4. B. exit all—Logs out of the Alcatel-Lucent 7750 SR/7450 ESS device.
The exit all command takes you to the root context but does not log you out.

5. A. Audit
This is not a valid log stream type.

6. D. IOMs plug into the chassis.
An IOM card supports two MDAs that provide the physical ports for a chassis.

7. C. boot.ldr
This is the file that contains the bootstrap image, and it is the first file that is read
upon system startup.

8. B. bof.cfg
The bof.cfg stores the boot file configuration parameters such as the Ethernet
management IP, the location of the config file, and the system image file.

9. A. boot.ldr, bof.cfg, system image, config.cfg
This is the correct order.

10. C. To ensure synchronization with the 5620 SAM
The persistence option is only needed if the 5620 SAM is used to manage your
Alcatel-Lucent device.

11. B. no shutdown
By default, all the ports and cards on an Alcatel-Lucent 7750 SR/7450 ESS are
down and need to have the no shutdown command used to enable them.

12. C. IOM, MDA, port
This is the correct provisioning order.

13. C. You must configure a filter for each log-id.
Configuration of a filter for a log-id is optional.

14. B. admin display-config
This is used to show the configuration of your Alcatel-Lucent device.

15. B. The list of IOM cards in the chassis
This value is not stored in the bof.cfg.

=== Chapter 3

1. C. Cell-Relay
There is no protocol called Cell-Relay; the other answers are all Data Link
protocols.

2. B. Support the connection of multiple devices on a single link.
There is an address field, but it is not used as there is no need for addressing on a
point-to-point link.

3. D. AAL1—High bit rate traffic
AAL1 is constant bit rate traffic.

4. B. Switched Ethernet
An Ethernet switch will forward the frame to the correct port based on a destination address in its FDB; all the other technologies broadcast all frames to all
devices.

5. C. Broadcasts are processed by every host.
Depending on the switch technology in use, multicast packets might also be
received by every host, but every host would not process the multicast packets if
they are not in the multicast group. Every device must strip the Ethernet header
and examine the contents of the upper layers of a broadcast to determine if the
packet is intended for it or not. This is a major disadvantage for broadcast traffic.

6. C. PPP is based on the HDLC frame format.
The HDLC protocol used the fields that PPP does not, and the fields are a legacy
of this.

7. A. To support latency-sensitive applications like voice traffic
This is the primary factor behind the small size of the cells. The other answers
don’t address the core reason for the size of the cells.

8. B. It maps data from upper-layer service classes to ATM cells.
ATM supports many classes of service, but data from upper-layer protocols must be
mapped to the 53-byte ATM cells For example, IP datagrams are encapsulated in
an AAL5 frame, which is then encapsulated in individual ATM cells.

9. D. 802.3 and Ethernet II
These are the two main types of Ethernet frames. The other answers are incorrect.

10. A. 64
A value less than 1536 indicates an 802.3 frame.

11. B. Every station on the wire had to be able to “detect” a collision in order to function properly.
Based on our description of CSMA/CD, it is implied that each station needs to be
able to determine when other stations are transmitting, which means that each
station needs to be within a certain distance of other stations so that the electrical
signals can reach it in no more than a fixed amount of time.

12. C. A 6-byte number in two parts
The two parts are the vendor OUI and the vendor-chosen hardware address.

13. B. Listen for other stations transmitting; if none, then begin transmitting.
This is a brief description of the “carrier sense multiple access” part of the CSMA/
CD protocol.

14. D. The signal results in a collision, and the stations stop and retransmit after waiting a random amount of time.
This is a brief description of how Ethernet stations retransmit after collision. They
wait a random amount of time to try to ensure that the same stations don’t transmit at the same time again.

15. C. 1 Gig Ethernet—Fiber cable only
Gigabit Ethernet can run over copper cabling as well.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 4

1. D. All except the port that received the frame
This is how switches work until they build up their FDB.

2. D. Switches forward unicast traffic only to a specific destination port.
This is opposed to hubs that act like a “wire in a box” and forward frames out
every port. Both hubs and switches forward broadcast traffic out all ports.

3. C. They can protect against a switch failure by calculating multiple paths to
the root.
This is a description of STP, not LAG.

4. D. It provides load-sharing capability.
STP cannot provide load-sharing because only a single path exists between each
segment and the root bridge to avoid loops.

5. D. A and C but not B
VLANs do not provide routing between broadcast domains although they do
create separate broadcast domains.

6. B. Hubs provide collision domain separation.
Hubs simply forward all frames out all ports and so do not provide collision
domain separation.

7. B. Uses the same physical link for each source/destination conversation.
This method is used to ensure that there is no frame reordering as required by the
802.3ad standard.

8. D. The LAG changes its OSPF cost for the bundle but takes no other action.
This is because the “dynamic-cost” option is configured on the bundle so that
each time a link fails, the OSPF cost is updated. No other action is taken because
the threshold is 2 and there are still four out of six active links functioning.

9. C. Redundant paths can lead to broadcast storms and FDB instability.
This describes the problem of loops in a switched network, which is the primary
reason to use STP.

10. A. STP elects a root and selectively blocks higher cost paths to the root from
each bridge.
This is an accurate description of the way STP functions to prevent loops.

11. C. The bridge priority unless there is a tie, and then the lowest MAC address
This is an accurate description of how a root bridge is selected. Answer D is wrong
because the BID is always used to determine the root bridge (note the unless
qualifier). In fact, answer C describes what the BID is: bridge priority plus MAC
address.

12. D. The back-up port is on the same switch as the designated switch.
The alternate port is on a non-designated switch on the same segment.

13. C. They require a separate physical connection per VLAN for interswitch links.
This is not true if a VLAN trunk is used between the switches.

14. D. Learning
In this state, the bridge learns information about MAC addresses but does not yet
forward frames.

15. C. VLAN stacking
VLAN stacking allows a provider to stack its own VLAN information in front of
the customer’s VLAN information to support customers with overlapping VLANs.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 5

1. C. Ethernet switches cannot build forwarding tables.
Ethernet switches, in fact, do build FDB tables of MAC addresses. The other
answers are all factors that prevent Ethernet from creating global networks.

2. B. It provides for a logical hierarchy.
This is one of the main reasons that IP can support global networks—the use of
hierarchical addressing.

3. D. The current version is IPv5.
The current version is IPv4, and the next version is IPv6.

4. D. 10.254.1.1
10.254.1.1 is the only valid host address. The other addresses are either out of supported IP address ranges, are in the broadcast range (255), or are multicast (224).

5. B. 193
Calculate this as 28
 + 27
 + 20
 = 128 + 64 + 1 = 193.

6. D. None of the above
This is a Class D or multicast address. You can tell this by examining the first
octet in binary: 224 = 128 + 64 + 32 = 11100000. The first 3 bits are 1, so this
indicates that it is a Class D address.

7. C. 200.1.1.254
The private address ranges are 10.0.0.0/8, 172.16.0.0/12, and 192.168.0.0/16.

8. B. You can identify the host portion of the address without the need for a mask.
This is true for classful addressing, but not for classless addressing. Using classless
addressing, you need the subnet mask to determine how many bits are used for the
subnet and how many for the host.

9. A. 16
If you need seven hosts per subnet, this means that you need to leave at least 4 bits
for each subnet because 24
 – 2 = 14 available hosts. This leaves 4 bits (8 – 4 = 4)
for the subnet, which means you can have 24
 = 16 subnets. 3 bits for each subnet is
not sufficient because two addresses (all zeros and all ones) cannot be used.

10. D. 128
The trick here is recognizing that if you need 300 hosts per subnet, then you need
to use more than 8 bits of the IP address for hosts because you can only have 255
max hosts for an 8-bit octet. If you borrow one of the bits from the third octet,
this gives you a maximum of 510 hosts, and leaves 7 bits of the third octet for subnets. 27
 = 128, so you can have 128 subnets.

11. C. /10
The key here is to remember that 255 means “all 1s,” so you know that the first
octet has all the bits used and therefore the mask is at least /8. 192 translates into
the highest 2 bits of the next octet: 27
 + 26
 = 128 + 64 + 192, so this means that
10 bits are used so the subnet mask is /10.

12. B. 2
The key here is “usable” host addresses. A /30 leaves 2 bits for hosts, which would
translate into 22
 = 4. However, the 0 host is the subnet address and the “all 1s”
host is the broadcast, so those addresses cannot be used. This leaves only two
usable host addresses.

13. D. subnet 10.1.1.0
B is not as correct because technically 10.1.1.0 is a subnet of network 10.0.0.0.

14. B. Route aggregation
CIDR is a technology that implements route aggregation, but the question asks
what the “concept” is called, and the concept is route aggregation.

15. B. 218
The key is to determine how many bits are available for subnetting. We know we
need 31 hosts, so we know we need at least 5 bits because 25
 = 32. However, we
lose 2 bits for each subnet for the subnet and broadcast address, so we actually
need 6 bits for the hosts because using 5 bits would only give us 30 hosts per subnet. Since there are 24 total available bits for subnets on network 10.0.0.0/8,
24 – 6 host bits = 18 subnet bits, and 218 = 262,144 available subnets.

16. C. 16,382
If there are four subnets, that means we have used 2 of the available host bits
because 22
 = 4. This leaves 16 – 2 = 14 bits for subnets, and 214 – 2 = 16,382.

17. C. 10.15.127.255
Using a /17 means that we have used 1 bit for the subnet, leaving 7 bits in the
third octet. The “all 1s” means to set all of those bits to 1 and all the bits in the
last octet to 1. This means that the last octet is 255 (8 bits set to 1) and the 3rd
octet is 127 (highest bit is 27
 = 128, so 255 – 128 = 127).

18. C. subnet 10.10.10.0/16
This value cannot be used as a subnet address since the host portion is not all
zeros. The other network addresses given all have the host portion all zeros. Any
valid address can be used as a host address.

19. B. /20 for the first eight subnets, /24 for the remaining 13
Because nine subnets are needed, we need to use 4 bits of the host address in the
third octet because 24
 = 16 possible subnets (3 bits would only yield eight subnets).
Then we need 13 more subnets, which means we need to take another 4 bits to
give us 16 more possible subnets (24
 = 16). This means we need 16 + 4 = /20 for
the first eight subnets and 16 + 4 + 4 = /24 for the remaining 13 subnets.

20. D. /19
We need to determine how many bits are needed to support 4,387 hosts. We know
that using 8 bits gives us 255 hosts (all 1s for a single octet). If we double this by
using an additional bit, that gives us 510 hosts; double again gives 1,020; double
again gives us 2,040; double again gives us 4,080; and double again gives us 8,160.
We had to double five times to get the desired number of hosts, which means we
had to take 5 bits + original 8 bits = 13 total bits for hosts from the available 16
(/16 was the original network). This leaves 3 bits left for subnetting (16 – 13 = 3),
so /16 + 3 bits = /19 subnet mask.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 6

1. C. Send a “received” message to the originating router.
IP does not guarantee delivery and does not attempt to inform the transmitting
router that packets have been received. Acknowledgement and recovery from
packet drops is performed by higher layer protocols.

2. C. Modern home networks make use of a variety of new services such as Video on
Demand and IP telephony.
Traditional home networks used only basic services such as Web browsing and
email.

3. D. The default gateway
A default gateway is the IP forwarding device that end-user IP devices send data to
for routing on the Internet.

4. A. NAT is used for many-to-one translations.
PAT is used for many-to-one translations, while NAT is used for one-to-one
translations.

5. B. DHCP
This is the protocol used to receive a dynamic IP address for a home router.

6. C. A client will send a unicast message to the first DHCP server it receives a
response from.
The response is actually a broadcast message so that any other DHCP servers
know they were not chosen by the requesting device.

7. A. The echo receive ICMP type.
This is not an ICMP message type.

8. B. They are created by routers that cannot deliver an IP packet to its destination.
The destination unreachable message is intended to inform the source host that
the destination address is unavailable.

9. D. The default gateway will issue an ARP request for the MAC address of the
originating host.
This is not necessary because the default gateway will cache this data based on
the information in the original ARP request from the originating host.

10. C. IP filters will automatically permit IP packets by default unless otherwise
configured.
The default action for an IP filter is to discard packets.

11. D. Originating host name
This is because the host name is not part of an IP packet.

12. B. default-action discard
The command should be default-action drop.

13. C. A and B together
Both A and B are required to match on the source IP address range and the destination IP address host.

14. B. default-action drop
default-action drop is not required because the default action, if no other action
is configured, is to drop packets that do not match any entries in the filter policy.

15. B. The interfaces where the filter is applied
This is not shown; all the other answers are part of the show filter output.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 7

1. C. RTP
TCP, UDP, and TP4 are transport protocols.

2. D. Transport layer protocols require additional software be added to your operating system.
All modern OSes come with a TCP/IP stack that includes the TCP transport
protocol.

3. B. Connectionless operation
TCP always requires the establishment of a connection.

4. A. Reliable data transfer
UDP does not provide reliable data transfer because it does not guarantee delivery.

5. D. RST—Re-sets the sequence numbers for a TCP session
RST indicates that a TCP connection is unavailable, if, for example, an attempt is
made to connect to a port that is not available.

6. D. 32
There are 32 bits in a sequence number.

7. C. SYN and ACK
Both bit sets are included in the packet.

8. B. FIN
FIN indicates that one side of an open connection wishes to initiate a close.

9. C. The sender’s congestion window and the receiver’s advertised window size
The sender will send the lower of the two values.

10. B. Duplicate ACK numbers
This indicates that the receiver has not received at least one segment and that
segment must be re-sent.

11. D. 10000
The sender can never send more than the advertised window size, which is 5000
(even if its congestion window is higher). If the initial sequence number is 5000,
then the next sequence number expected by the receiver is always the sequence
number (5000) + the number of bytes sent (5000) = 10000.

12. B. An application that is sensitive to packet loss
This is because UDP does not guarantee delivery so it would be better to use TCP
to avoid packet loss.

13. D. It adds little overhead to the data transfer.
UDP does not require connection establishment and has a small header, so it adds
very little overhead to an application.

14. D. 65938
This is outside the acceptable range of ephemeral ports, 1024–65535.

15. D. UDP cannot be used for bulk file transfers.
While it is usually better not to use UDP for bulk file transfers, it can be done
(TFTP uses UDP for bulk file transfers). The other answers are all good reasons
for DNS to use both TCP and UDP for different functions.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 8

1. A. The destination IP address only
This is normally the only information that is used to determine how to forward an
IP packet.

2. D. EGP
IGP and EGP are the two main types of routing protocols.

3. B. It is used between ASes.
IGPs are used exclusively inside a single AS.

4. C. Routing table
Each routing protocol has its own RIB, and the RTM selects routes from each RIB
to place in the routing table/FIB.

5. D. Distance vector—IS-IS
IS-IS is a link state routing protocol.

6. B. On links with only a single path to other routers
This is by far the most common situation to use a static route; you might use them
in small networks, but even in small networks, routing protocols have an advantage over static routes.

7. D. Distance vector protocols rely on updates only from neighbors.
Link state protocols flood LSPs throughout the network, and then each router calculates the routes independently so convergence can be very fast. Distance vector
protocols have to wait for each router to recalculate its own routing table before
sending an update leading to slower convergence.

8. B. Distance vector does not require extensive processing to build routing tables.
Link state protocols rely on calculating paths using the Shortest Path First algorithm. If you have older routers with slower CPUs, this can take additional time
to create the routing table. Distance vector protocols do not perform this sort of
complex algorithm.

9. C. SPF
The Shortest Path First algorithm is used by link state routing protocols.

10. B. A default route
While technically this is a type of static route, it is more accurate to call it a
default route. This is the type of route most likely to be found on stub networks.

11. B. The control plane
This is the function that is used to build routing tables.

12. D. The link state database
This is where link state information is stored to build the routing table.

13. C. It enters the lowest preference value in the routing table.
The RTM prefers the routing protocol with the lowest preference value.

14. A. Each router has a common view of the network.
Each router receives the same LSPs and should have the same link state database.
It then builds a path to each network using the SPF algorithm to create its routing
table.

15. B. It sends its entire routing table.
This is how distance vector protocols update neighbor routers.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 9

1. C. Using Hello advertisements
OSPF sends Hello packets to the 224.0.0.5 multicast IP address to discover other
OSPF routers.

2. D. It uses a hop count–based metric.
OSPF uses a cost value on each interface that is based on the bandwidth of the
link; it does not use a hop count.

3. D. System interface
It is recommended that you use the system interface as the router ID.

4. B. To uniquely identify an OSPF router
Every OSPF router must have a router ID to uniquely identify it for purposes of
building the SPF tree and identifying its LSA updates.

5. A. Every 30 minutes
LSA updates are sent every 30 minutes in order to refresh the LSA. They are sent
regardless of whether changes have occurred.

6. B. The routers are on a common network segment and have exchanged database
information.
Routers that have shared database information are referred to as adjacent. Not all
neighbor OSPF routers become adjacent.

7. C. They will automatically become adjacent provided certain OSPF configuration
values match.
The area ID and Hello and dead timers must match in the Hello packets.

8. B. The priority
The priority value is only applicable on OSPF broadcast networks.

9. B. The OSPF MTU
This is based on the interface MTU and must match on each router.

10. D. show router ospf database
This command displays the LSAs that have been received from other OSPF
routers.

11. B. The router LSA
The router LSA carries the local topology information for each router in the
network.

12. C. Drop the LSA and send an acknowledgment
The router already has the information so it will drop the LSA, but all LSAs must
be acknowledged.

13. C. It is run only on the router that originates an LSA update.
Whenever an LSA update is flooded throughout the network, all routers must
rerun the SPF algorithm.

14. C. ExStart, Exchange, Loading, Full
This is the correct order.

15. D. 622-Mbps link = 16
(100 Gbps)/(622 Mbps) = 160, not 16.


===================================================================================================================
===================================================================================================================
=== Chapter 10

1. B. Distribute routing information between ASes
BPG is an EGP protocol so it is used between different ASes.

2. D. The AS usually contains routers under the control of different administrative
groups.
An AS is usually under the control of a single group.

3. D. System interface
This is the preferred interface for internal BGP sessions because iBGP peers are
often not directly connected to each other.

4. C. They can be in the same or different AS.
You can have both internal BGP and external BGP sessions.

5. C. TCP on a fixed port
BGP uses TCP port 179.

6. A. To ensure that routers inside an AS have a common view of networks outside
the AS
This is to ensure that routers inside the AS choose the correct exit point for
routes in other ASes.

7. B. The shortest AS path
BGP uses AS path information to choose the best route to each destination.

8. C. An update message
The BGP update message contains the NLRI, or route information, exchanged by
BGP peers.

9. D. The AS number is associated with each peer statement.
You must configure an AS number for each neighbor, and this allows you to determine if the peer is internal or external. Internal peers have the same AS number.

10. B. show router bgp summary
This command is used to see the state of your BGP information. There is no
show router bgp status command as there is for other routing protocols.

11. C. Send a withdraw message
BGP will actively send withdraw messages to its peers to remove previously advertised routes that are no longer available.

12. B. An enterprise with multiple connections to the same ISP
In such a situation, the enterprise can use equal cost default routes to load balance
across the multiple links; there is no need to complicate the routing with BGP.

13. D. AS-path, origin, and next-hop
These attributes are included with every BGP network update for each destination.

14. A. It is the single exit point for an AS.
If there is only one exit point from an AS, there is little reason for a BGP router to
receive full Internet routing tables.

15. D. Route re-distribution provides for greater policy control.
BGP provides for much greater policy control than simple IGP route
re-distribution.

1. B. It is responsible for adding and removing labels.
Answer A is a CE, and answer C is a P. D is partially correct, but B is the more
accurate answer.

2. B. It is specific to a single service.
 SDPs are not specific to a single service and can support multiple services.

3. D. Any network that includes encryption
Encryption can be a part of a VPN, but the correct description of a VPN should
include a way to privatize communications between user communities. The other
answers speak to this, but answer D does not.

4. C. It is the only method for distributing labels in an MPLS network.
 LDP is only one method of distributing labels; RSVP can be used as well as other
protocols.

5. C. Label distribution protocol—Series of labels and next-hop interfaces
This description is the Label Switched Path.

6. C. LDP
LDP is the most common label distribution protocol.

7. B. VPNM
VPNM is not a type of VPN.

8. C. VPWS
VPWS is a VPN that emulates a point-to-point service between two destinations.

9. B. VPLS
VPLS is a VPN that must maintain a table of MAC addresses.

10. D. None of the above
None of the VPN services provided by an MPLS network require encryption.

11. B. VPRN
VPRN is a VPN that appears to a customer as a private routed network.

12. D. P
P routers swap labels and forward them to other P or PE routers.
